## Managing dependencies with Composer Manager

[Composer Manager](https://drupal.org/project/composer_manager) discovers each module’s composer.json file and adds it to the above mentioned merge list.

> cd mysiteroot
drush dl composer_manager
php modules/composer_manager/scripts/init.php
composer drupal-update

And we’re done. The vendor directory now contains our module’s dependencies.
Once we decide to install another module with Composer dependencies, for example Drupal Commerce, we just need to download that module, then run ```composer drupal-update``` again.
