## Managing dependencies with Composer Manager

[Composer Manager](https://drupal.org/project/composer_manager) discovers each module’s composer.json file and adds it to the above mentioned merge list.

    cd mysiteroot  
    drush dl composer_manager  
    php modules/composer_manager/scripts/init.php  
    composer drupal-update  

And we’re done. The vendor directory now contains our module’s dependencies.
Once we decide to install another module with Composer dependencies, for example Drupal Commerce, we just need to download that module, then run `composer drupal-update` again.
